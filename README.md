As developers, we are open to anyone who is willing to contribute to this project. To get started, pull the repository to your local environment: 

    git clone https://github.com/OpenSoundQueue/OpenSoundQueue.git

You are good to go and start developing your feature. 

Once you are done with the feature, and you are certain that you removed all the bugs, you can go ahead and create a pull request. Our Devs will have a look at your change, run some tests to verify the integrity and finally either approve the request or get back to you with suggestions or comments for you to improve your code.
