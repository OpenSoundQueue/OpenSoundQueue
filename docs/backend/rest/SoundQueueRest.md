- `UserService`: Manages user information and interactions, such as updating the last online time based on actions performed.

```java
public SoundQueueRest(SongQueueService songQueueService, UserService userService) {
    this.songQueueService = songQueueService;
    this.userService = userService;
}
```

In summary, the `SoundQueueRest` class offers a comprehensive suite of RESTful APIs tailored for managing a dynamic and interactive song queue, enhancing the user experience in music streaming applications. Its design promotes easy navigation, control, and enjoyment of music by providing functionalities like song queue management, playback control, volume adjustment, and historical song search.
