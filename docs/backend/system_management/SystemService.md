# SystemService.java Documentation ðŸ“„

`SystemService.java` is a Java class that is part of a larger backend system, typically found within a project utilizing the Spring Framework. This class is responsible for handling system-related operations, specifically focusing on verifying entry codes. Below, you'll find a detailed breakdown of this code file, including its purpose, methods, and interactions with other components.

## Overview

The `SystemService` class is annotated with `@Service`, indicating that it is a Spring-managed service bean. Its primary role is to interact with the `PropertyService` to validate entry codes. This interaction suggests a separation of concerns where `SystemService` handles business logic, and `PropertyService` deals with property retrieval, likely from some external or internal configuration source.

## Dependencies

The class depends on the following import statements:

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import java.io.IOException;
```

- **@Service**: A Spring Framework annotation that marks the class as a service, making it eligible for Spring's component scanning to detect and configure it as a bean in the Spring application context.
- **IOException**: An exception class for handling IO errors, used here in the signature of the `checkEntryCode` method.

## Class Definition

```java
@Service
public class SystemService {
    PropertyService propertyService;
    
    // Constructor and methods are defined here
}
```

- **PropertyService propertyService**: A reference to `PropertyService`, indicating a dependency that is likely injected via the constructor.

## Constructor

```java
public SystemService(PropertyService propertyService) {
    this.propertyService = propertyService;
}
```

The constructor takes a `PropertyService` object as an argument and assigns it to the class's `propertyService` field. This dependency injection pattern allows for easier testing and configuration.

## Methods

### checkEntryCode

```java
public boolean checkEntryCode(String code) throws IOException {
    return propertyService.getProperty("system.entry-code").equals(code);
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `code`: The entry code as a `String`.

**Returns:**
- `boolean`: `true` if the entry code matches the one retrieved from `propertyService`, otherwise `false`.

**Throws:**
- `IOException`: If an IO error occurs during property retrieval.

**Description:**
Checks the validity of an entry code by comparing it against a value retrieved from `propertyService`. This method is critical for ensuring that only users with the correct entry code can access certain functionalities or parts of the system.

## Usage

To use `SystemService`, instantiate it with a `PropertyService` object, either manually or through Spring's dependency injection. Then, call `checkEntryCode` with the code you wish to validate. Handle the `IOException` as necessary.

```java
// Example instantiation and usage
PropertyService propertyService = new PropertyService(); // Assuming a constructor or a mock for demonstration
SystemService systemService = new SystemService(propertyService);

try {
    boolean isValid = systemService.checkEntryCode("1234");
    System.out.println("Is valid: " + isValid);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

This documentation covers the key aspects of `SystemService.java`, providing a clear understanding of its functionality and integration within a Spring-based backend system.
